        <h2>Social Life at St. Andrew's Church</h2>

        <p>As well as the opportunity for fellowship each Sunday at worship and at the informal refreshments after the 9.30 am service, we have an active and varied calendar of events, sometimes these are for fund-raising and sometimes merely for pleasure!</p>

        <div class="centre-600"><img src="../images/events-picnic.jpg" alt="" class="fluid" /></a></div>

        <p>We hold occasional Sunday lunches and Parish Teas which are extremely popular.</p>

        <p>Other events include Quiz Nights, Poetry and Puddings evenings, tea in the Vicarage Garden, barn dances, promises Auctions – almost anything that includes food and the chance to meet, chat and have fun!</p>

        <div class="centre-600"><img src="../images/events-salisbury2016.jpg" alt="" class="fluid" /></a></div>

        <p>Each year group bookings are made for theatre trips to Worthing and Chichester and between 40 and 100 folk participate.</p>

        <p>Our speakers are varied and include talks and demonstrations.</p>

        <p><strong>St. Andrew's Table Tennis Group</strong>: The Thursday Table Tennis Group is a mixed group (both in terms of ability and gender!) and although quite competitive, we primarily meet for the exercise and the friendship.</p>
